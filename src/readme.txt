== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Hey! Why don't you have any Frequently Asked Questions here! =

Because the majority of users end up on my web site asking for help anyway -- and it's simply more difficult to maintain two copies of my Frequently Asked Questions. Please visit [my web site FAQ](http://www.joedolson.com/my-calendar/faq/) to read my Frequently Asked Questions!

= This plug-in is really complicated. Why can't you personally help me figure out how to use it? =

I can! But not in person. Take a look at my [documentation website for My Calendar](http://docs.joedolson.com/my-calendar/) before making your request, and consider [making a donation](https://www.joedolson.com/donate.php)!

= Can my visitors or members submit events? =

I've written a paid plug-in that adds this feature to My Calendar, called My Calendar Pro. [Buy it today](https://www.joedolson.com/my-calendar/pro/)!

= Is there an advanced search feature? =

The search feature in My Calendar is pretty basic; but buying My Calendar Pro gives you a richer search feature, where you can narrow by dates, categories, authors, and more to refine your event search.
