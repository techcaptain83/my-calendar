= Hey! Why don't you have any Frequently Asked Questions here! =

Because the majority of users end up on my web site asking for help anyway -- and it's simply more difficult to maintain two copies of my Frequently Asked Questions. Please visit [my web site FAQ](http://www.joedolson.com/my-calendar/faq/) to read my Frequently Asked Questions!

= Is there an advanced search feature? =

The search feature in My Calendar is pretty basic; but buying My Calendar Pro gives you a richer search feature, where you can narrow by dates, categories, authors, and more to refine your event search.
