# Thank you for contributing to My Calendar!

Before you contribute, please read these guidelines:

1) Open an issue before creating a pull request. You can go ahead and create the pull request immediately, but I would like to have the issue represented separately from the PR. I may reject the PR, but that doesn't mean that I will necessarily close the issue.
2) All code in My Calendar needs to follow the WordPress Code standards. I will ask for your Pull Requests to be updated to meet those standards, so that I don't spend all of my time fixing formatting issues. 

And again, thank you!
